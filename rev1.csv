I read Lindsay's excellent books - Darkly Dreaming Dexter and Dearly
Devoted Dexter - some time ago, and when I heard that there was to be a
series based on the books, I was extremely excited. So much so, in
fact, that I feared disappointment merely because my standards were so
high.<br><br>Thankfully, ""Dexter"" absolutely delivers. The show maintains the
uncomfortable atmosphere of the novels with better fidelity than one
could ever have expected, and Dexter (played by Hall) is all there.<br><br>The visual elements from the show are stunning, to say the least.
Disturbing, certainly, but more than that - fascinating. Watching the
show, it's impossible to keep from finding a certain agreement in
oneself for Dexter. He's a monster, and yet it's completely possible to
identify with him.<br><br>10 out of 10. This one has a permanent spot on my DVR.

Dexter is the show I have been waiting for my whole television watching
life! The complex and damaged characters, the twisted plot line and
Dexter's foster dad grooming him, educating him, to make him the
perfect avenger,its all so intoxicating! I am breathlessly anticipating
the next episode. This show is not only well acted, with each and every
main character holding my full attention, but written with such deep
intensity that I find it absolutely irresistible! I really find it
difficult to wait and see more of how Dex was traumatized as a child,
more of Harry's lessons, more of the growing relationship with Rita,
more of the ice truck killer, more forensics...More of this great show
period. Kudos to all involved...this show will surely be a huge hit!

Absolutely brilliant. True to Jeff Lindsay's books. The visual contrast
between the darkness of Dexter's secret life and and the gloss of Miami
adds an almost surreal quality. Character development is right on the
money, bringing out the background slowly so one can see the
development of Dexter's sociopath personality and his confusion of
human behavior compared to his own. Dexter is an actor in his own life;
his relationships between co-workers and his personal life are well
shown in the video media. The fact that he is a blood splatter expert
This is a dark work, but set in the bizarre world of life in Miami is
almost believable. Developers of this series should also look to Andrew
Vachss's books.

Between Dexter and Weeds, Showtime has a corner on the original new
shows market. Not only are both of these shows completely original and
innovative, but they are REALLY good.<br><br>Dexter, in particular, should not be reviewed by anyone who hasn't seen
more than three episodes. I almost feel as if the first episode in the
series is a tad-bit melodramatic (note Dexter screaming in the face of
his first victim) just to pull in viewers that otherwise need something
more visceral than a great screenplay.<br><br>By two more episodes the viewer should be absolutely intoxicated by the
complexity of the character Dexter and the acting of Michael C. Hall.
His own co-stars admit to being almost ""scared"" by how well Hall
absorbs his character. Personally, I think that without Hall's mastery
of Dexter there would be nothing to watch. Don't get me wrong, the plot
of this show is extremely intriguing (and original, to be redundant),
but the excitement lies purely in the way Dexter/Hall responds to A)
his girlfriend, B) blood, and C) other serial killers.<br><br>I think that it is very reasonable to chuckle at Dexter's attempts to
""fit in"" social situations and I believe the writers of this show
planned on it. What I am still stuck on, however, is whether or not to
cheer Dexter on in his methodology (serial killing serial killers).
This had better be the first of many seasons, so spread the word...<br><br>...Edit: I watched this series finale last night and come back to this
review (which I wrote after the conclusion of Season 1) with my hat in
hand to say: ""I'm kind of sorry for the hype.""<br><br>If my review was the impetus for your 'Dexter' obsession (I, too, was
obsessed) then I owe you an apology for the way it all ended. Sure,
sure, I couldn't have known how poorly written the resolution of this
once-magnificent series would be. But, you see, I shouted praises for
this show from roof-tops...telling every friend who would engage me in
discussion about pop-culture that they NEEDED TO WATCH DEXTER, it's the
greatest drama on television!<br><br>Alas, I will not leave any spoilers here and if you've come along the
journey with me then you will undoubtedly watch how it all ends, but I
write this edit in vain so that you, internet friend, cannot say that I
didn't warn you: 'Dexter' leaves me wanting a real ending.

After four episodes, I'm ready to proclaim this the best show currently
on TV, one that may someday rank with the likes of _The Sopranos_ and
the first season of _Twin Peaks_ as a contender for the second best TV
show ever (after the incomparable _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_; one of
the show's producers and writers is former Buffy writer Drew Z.
Greenberg, and the cast includes Buffy / Angel mainstay Julie Benz).<br><br>Dexter is a sociopath, someone with no human feelings and hence no
natural, inner moral compass, and he has an unquenchable blood lust
that drives him to kill. But he had the great grace to have been the
adopted child of a police officer, who (as we see in terrific
flashbacks) successfully instilled in him a complete moral code, which
he adheres to on a strictly intellectual level. This is an utterly
brilliant concept (which I assume derives from the novels it's based
on), one that allows the writers to explore the nature of moral
behavior and of what it means to be human (Dexter is, in a sense, an
alien).<br><br>Another thing the show is doing brilliantly is moving at different
speeds in parallel. There is a primary apparent season-long story arc
(concerning a cat-and-mouse game between Dexter and a serial killer),
and a a secondary arc involving Dexter's sister's police career. The
first handful of episodes include a very powerful completed arc
concerning one of Dexter's police colleagues and a local crime lord,
while two of the four episodes so far have also included a
self-contained story spliced among (and playing off) the ongoing ones.
I've seen the future of TV season structuring, and this is it.<br><br>While the writing isn't quite up to the brilliance of the best of
_House_, it's been excellent. The cast and production are terrific. The
only reason you wouldn't want to watch this utterly brilliant show is
the frequent use of extremely graphic images: there have probably been
more severed body parts shown in these first four episodes than in the
first four episodes of every other TV show on the air combined. If you
can stomach that, tune it for a mesmerizing look at what makes us human
-- or inhuman.

Dexter is hilarious; it is easily the best new show on TV! Dark, dry
humor crops up in the most unexpected places, and the settings and
dialogue are laced with CSI's pseudo-scientific appeal. While the show
may appear to treat standard morality as irreverent, it is actually an
excellent study of humanity at its best -- and worse.<br><br>The character of Dexter, a disassociated, psychopathic serial killer,
is somewhat reminiscent of Data, the android in the Star Trek series.
Dexter is devoid of normal, human emotion, and has to learn behaviors
by rote. Seeing the world through his eyes enables us to closely
examine what is ""right"" and what is ""wrong."" We have to pause and
wonder about our own perception of reality.<br><br>Overall, the show is a side-splitting outlet for the vigilante/serial
killer/dysfunctional being in all of us. Well done!

Dexter, a forensics expert at day, serial killer with a touch of
vigilantism at night. Dexter is creating a believable and very detailed
portrait of a, lets say troubled, sociopath. One of the parts about the
show I like best is the emotions that normal people exhibit, thus
forcing Dexter to mimic them. Good laugh when the emotions Dexter fake
get real, and he is scared out of his mind, like in the relationship
with his ""girlfriend"" Rita, mother of two and victim of her abusive
ex-boyfriend. Also liked the acting of Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's
sister Debra, adds a nice touch colour to the show, without drifting
into clich√©s.<br><br>Thrilling story, many details, and one of the best opening sequences
ever.

"<p>
HBO Actors, HBO Directors, HBO Writers, and Showtime's willingness to
take risks that HBO might not see as profitable these days (Carnivale +
Deadwood R.I.P.) make for a killer combination in ""Dexter,"" the new Sho
Comedy/Drama about a Serial Killer Killing Serial Killer (you read
right). In my opinion, Showtime has always had a hard time producing an
original series that's truly original and good, so it's incredibly
refreshing to see the network pull such a ""Hail Mary"" move and come out
on top. ""Dexter"" is, without spoiling anything, an excellent vehicle
for Michael C. Hall, and explores the inner monologue of a Serial
Killer in a way that has never been approached before without seeming
too predictable or hokey. Watch it and you will not be disappointed.
You'll even want to watch the next episode, which says a lot
considering the network. I just hope they don't screw it up.

Although I am not a regular proponent of serial television shows, the
eclectic, in-depth storyline and character development in Dexter are
far beyond what I expected from Showtime or any network other than HBO.
Dexter is a unique insight into the mind of a serial killer protected
by his occupation as well as the lessons derived from his father's
teachings. By having a resounding premise of catching a notorious
serial killer while trying to conceal his own identity, Dexter enters
each week with a new sociological dilemma as well as a new criminal to
dispatch. What is best about Dexter is his own personal facade of
trying to be normal. While other characters in the show are obviously
dysfunctional, the audience are privileged to see the flaws of Dexter
while people within his own world cannot. Darkly humorous, well-paced,
and morbidly addictive Dexter is the best show of 2006, without a
doubt.
