"APPLE D NAME ITSELF DESCRIBES D QUALITY.
ITS PERFECT 4M EVERY ASPECT.
IN MY PERSONAL OPINION EVERY HUMAN IN MODERN WORLD SHOULD HAV THE I PHONE.
I CONSIDER IT  AS AN EXTENSION OF HUMAN BODY.
IF UR JUMBLED UP BETWEEN TOO MANY OPTION AND BUDGET IS NOT A PROBLEM DEN GO FOR IT.
NO DOUBT COST IS QUITE HIGH BUT ITS WORTH BUYING . 

1.D DESIGN IS PRECISE AND EACH PART IS VERY NEATLY CARVED FROM A SINGLE ALUMINIUM BODY.

2.D DISPLAY IS AWESOME U CAN COMPARE IT WITH ANY AVAILABLE DISPLAY OF D WORLD.

3.SOUND QUALITY IS JUST WOW. ITS QUITE MORE BETTER BY PUTTING A HEADSET.

4.TOUCH SENSITIVITY IS UNCOMPARABLE.

5. CAMERA IS VERY GOOD WITH TRUELIGHT FLASH.I M A HOBBYIST PHOTOGRAPHER VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH IT.
6.NEW TECH LIKE FINGER ID DETECTION IS WORKING VERY NYCLY.

7.BATTERY BACK UP IS VERY GOOD.

8.SPECIFICALLY SPACE GREY COLOUR IS ATTRACTIVE. D APPLE LOGO IS QUITE MORE VISIBLE IN WHITE.

9. CELLULAR , 3G AND WIFI NETWORK ARE ITS BEST.

10. U HAV TO BUY SOME IMP APPS THATS THE GREATEST DRAWBACK I THINK OVER ANDROID.

IN MY OPINION IF U ARE A APPLE FAN AND NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT BUDGET DEN GO FOR IT."
"if you're looking for a phone under 30k, there's no phone better than this. Have used it for a week now and faced no issues with the product. I recommend it to all those looking for a handy, light weight and a good camera phone."
Well delivered in time no hanky Panky right product delivered hats off to snap deal
"Very good iphone 5s 16gb  and champagne gold colour , I really like it , new function  finger touch I'd password and iOS 7 software . We want to buy more for my family but it's out of stock."
"I received my order within 3-4 days which was well before the promised time frame. The product is genuine (I checked it through iPhone's web site). Packing was good. Only improvement which I would suggest to Snapdeal delivery - please make provision to swipe debit card on delivery. I had to take out cash from ATM to pay to delivery guy. I was also not ready to pay in advance as I am a bit skeptic about pre-payment.

I have been an android user so far and some people told me that Apps availability is an issue with iPhone. Let me assure you all, its not true!!!! I found that all my required free android apps works well in iPhone and are free for iPhone as well. Finger print scanner is a delightful feature and works very well. Also, migrating from android to iOS is quite easy."
"Only one thing that i dont like is battery but new box comes with new chargere or adaptors which have fast charging ability you can nearly fully charge in 1 hour. Other features are just aweseom like camera which is just 8 megapixel back side but can take over many smartphones with 13 mg camera , night photography is alsobvery good ,also front camera does it job well,it is also pocket friendly with 4 inch screen,one of the most important thing buy it from snapdeal because you can get it in nearly 4000-5000 less bucks than those offered in market,i get my iphone in fully new sealed pack condition,i also checked iphone and its accessories and they are 100% original, i have also checked my warranty and its is of full one year,if you want to check your warranty go to apple india website  and open support in that scroll down and select service and support then select service and support coverage then enter your serial number in the space provided on the page which opens, you can check your serial number in settings-general-about phone -scroll down there you will see your serial number. And finally i will tell you you can definately go with this iphone 5s its good in comparison to many other phones in this price segment. Also a great thanks to flipkart team and courier guys to deliver it fast and safely to me and also a original one. thank you SNAPDEAL TEAM !!!!....!!!!........."
